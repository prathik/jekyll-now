title: Finding files beautifully in Emacs
---

Projectile is the best way to find files within a project in Emacs.

Helm provides an amazing way to get a list of files from which you can pick one.

Helm-Projectile brings the best of both worlds.

Install Projectile and Helm. Install Helm-Projectile and run `C-c p h` to find files within a project (git) quickly and easily.
